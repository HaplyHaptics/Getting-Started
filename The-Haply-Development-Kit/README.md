## Introduction


The Haply development kit is a robust and adaptable open-source hardware
development platform for haptic applications. Designed to be accessible
to novices and experts alike, the kit allows you to quickly setup and
interact with a haptic simulation using a 2-degree-of-freedom pantograph
device.

## Kit Overview


The Haply development kit contains all the mechanical and electrical
components needed to construct your own 2-degree-of-freedom pantograph
device.

Using the hAPI or Haply API, and with a myriad of example projects and
detailed setup tutorials available, the kit allows you to quickly start
developing your own haptic applications.

With design expansion in mind, the Haply Control Board is capable of
controlling up to up to 4 motors. Allowing experienced users to develop
their own unique designs ranging from 1-degree-of-freedom to
4-degree-of-freedom haptic devices.

## Overview

The Haply control board is a highly robust and configurable open-source
platform ideal for haptic and robotic development.

Based on the Arduino Due, the Haply board uses the 32-bit AT91SAM3X8E
ARM microcontroller as its core. Side rail pin connections are
maintained giving the Haply board compatibility to a majority of
available Arduino Shields.

Two L298P Motor drivers are incorporated into the board, allowing the
Haply control board the ability to precisely control up to four DC
motors.

The Haply control board is fully compatible with the Arduino IDE and
programmable through the Native USB port.

Device Assembly
===============

Before proceeding with the device assembly, please check over the
inventory of the kit contents from the previous section. You will need also
need a small flat head screw driver and a small Philips head (cross
head) screw driver for device assembly.

Please peel off all protective plastics on the acrylic pieces, and
attach the acrylic plate to the 1x 3D printed Base with 3x
2-56 screws using the appropriate Allen key.

***Warning: Take care not to over tighten screws**

**The completed Haply Development Kit**


    The Haply project is intended to provide novice designers and developers 
	a platform from which to explore the field of haptics. The Haptics Application 
	Programming Interface (hAPI) is a modular tool that lets users quickly assemble 
	a variety of haptic robots, ranging from one to four degrees of freedom, using
	the same set of hardware and programming tools. We hope people will be inspired
	to build new tools to interface with the hAPI and share them with the community.
